# html-boilerplate
My starting off point for building small static marketing sites

## How to install

1. Fork this repo
2. Change the repository property in the package.json file to point to your repo.
3. navigate to project directory with terminal
4. run "npm install" to install gulp dependencies
5. run "gulp" to build files
6. run "gulp watch" to watch for changes in "src" directory

## Editing SCSS and JS files

When making changes please make sure you are making changes in the "src" dir. Gulp will automatically compile the files in to the webapp/static dir.

## Technology used in this project

1. HTML5 boilerplate

3. jQuery
4. jQuery Mobile
5. Modernizr
